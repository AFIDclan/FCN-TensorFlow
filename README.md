<h1>Fully-Convolutional Network in TensorFlow</h1> <br/>
This repository provides a basic implementation of Fully-Convolutional Network in TensorFlow. The code uses pretrained VGG network for its initialization. Refer to the paper for more details <b>[https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~f15ece6504/slides/L13_FCN.pdf]</b>. For training the network on your own dataset, modify the code available in the file <b>inputReader.py</b> to read in the data. Use <b>trainer_fcn.py</b> script to start training.
